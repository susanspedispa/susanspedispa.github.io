I would like to introduce the Proprietor, Susan Bolyen. Born in the sleepy Napa Valley of California, she spent her formative year's right here in Arizona, down the hill in Cottonwood. As a young woman she attended Northern Arizona University for a short time, before serving her country as a member of the United States Air Force during the Liberation of Kuwait.</p>

Having had enough of being told what to do, she established her own command, when she married her husband Thomas of 23 years and homeschooled two young men, Evan and Aaron, who now attend NAU. She has worked as a web host and author for the internet start-up The Mining Company, who you may now know as About.com.

Susan later went on to partner a family Medical Billing Practice, until the untimely death of the founder and her beloved mother. After which she took time to reflect and revaluate her career path. She re-educated herself and passed the State Board Exam to become a Certified Nail Technician of the great state of Arizona. Susan is passionate about offering the best possible service and continues to look for ways to improve her skills. Her latest adventure in education will be to complete the requirements for a Bachelor of Science in Podology.
