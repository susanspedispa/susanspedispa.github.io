  I love making people happy with beautiful nail designs and sharing my day with incredible clients!

I was born and raised here in Flagstaff and have lived here all my life, from what I hear, that's pretty rare! :)

I knew at a young age that I wanted to do something creative and artsy. I did very well in anything that involved drawing, designing, or thinking outside of the box- and that's why I love to do nail art, who knew toenails could become a tiny canvas? I was fortunate enough to get a jump start in cosmotology and start doing what I love making people happy with beautiful nail designs and sharing my day with incredible clients.

I am always running around with my family. We are very close! I have a brother, Josh, who grew up playing ice hockey and riding motorcycles- a true dare devil. My mom, a nurse for 20 plus years, is always by my side and is a huge influence for me. My dad grew up here in Flagstaff as well, and builds big, fancy houses around Norhern Arizona.

I have a houseful of crazy pets- so there is never a dull moment. You can find me hiking or taking a drive with them when I'm not busy meeting new clients.

I love what I do! Who woundn't want to spend their day telling stories, making people feel great and getting to know the amazing people that come from all walks of life? :)
