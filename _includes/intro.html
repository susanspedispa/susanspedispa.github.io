<p><i>Understand that we are a small spa with no front desk staff and we feel very strongly that our clients have the very best experience while here. It is for that reason that we never interrupt a service to answer a phone call. Each and every client deserves 100% of our attention and we strive to give it to them. Therefore, we hope you understand that when you call we may not answer, so please leave a message, text us, send an email or book your appointment online. We promise to devote our time and attention to YOU when you come in for your appointment. We try to respond to messages in 24-48 hours. However if you call for the same day service we may not respond since the time you requested will have already passed.</i></p>
