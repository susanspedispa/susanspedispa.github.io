<p><i> We do NOT do Acrylics. Please understand that we are a small spa with no front desk staff. We feel very strongly that our clients have the very best experience while here. For this reason we never interrupt a service to answer the phone. Each and every client deserves 100% of our attention and we strive to give it to them. We hope you understand that when you call we may not answer, so please leave a message, text us, send an email (susanspedispa@gmail.com) or book your appointment online. We promise to devote our time and attention to YOU when you come in for your appointment. We try to respond to messages in 24-48 hours - if you call for the same day service we may not respond since the time you requested will have already passed.</i></p>
