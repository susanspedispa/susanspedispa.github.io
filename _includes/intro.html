<p><b> We will be reopening in June please email us for an appointment. The online scheduling system will not be turned back on for a while. - S</b></br><p>We do NOT do Acrylics. <p>Please understand that we are a small spa with no front desk staff. We try to respond to messages in 24-48 hours - if you call for the same day service we may not respond since the time you requested may have already passed. <p>We feel very strongly that our clients have the very best experience while here, for this reason we never interrupt a service to answer the phone. Each and every client deserves 100% of our attention and we strive to give it to them. <p>We hope you understand that when you call we may not answer, so please leave a message, text us, send an email (susanspedispa@gmail.com) or book your appointment online. We promise to devote our time and attention to YOU when you come in for your appointment.</i></p> If you are looking for Kim Marr please call : 928.607.2642
