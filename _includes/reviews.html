My pedicure service was excellent! She cleaned the bowl right before the service and she did use antiseptic agent to clean the bowl. Message was great! I am definitely will go back to face and body spa for another pedicure service.<br>

As usual, my pedicure experience with SUSAN-was wonderful! Relaxing-a respite from my hectic day. AND....i love my "toe color"-so much that I bought it the day day-along with another OPI polish. I am sure I will become a "regular" client of Susan's-I have made my next appontment already<p>
