My pedicure service was excellent! She cleaned the bowl right before the service and she did use antiseptic agent to clean the bowl. Message was great! I am definitely will go back to face and body spa for another pedicure service.<br>

First spa pedicure at Flag Face and Body - Much better than the pedi I received from Scottsdale Princess. Definitely going back for another!<br>
