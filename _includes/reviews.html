<div class="reviewquotes">Excellent atmosphere very,very clean & sanitary. Quality products! A little on the $$ side but you get what you pay for! I can only go a few times a year! But if I were a professional with a professional income I would be a regular! She's specializes is safe, sanitary pedicures with people who have health issues! She's the only certified pedicurist in town!</div>

<div class="reviewquotes">My husband and I went to Susan's on a Saturday for pedis. Susan took the time to get to know us and ensure we would have everything we would need. When her other technician failed to show, she was like wonder woman and did both of us simultaneously. Even though she was going back and forth between us, we never felt like we were being rushed or neglected. She also was very careful to keep everything sanitary - she must have gone through an entire box of gloves doing us both with as many times as she changed them. Being in healthcare, the sanitary aspect of pedi places has always freaked me out but Susan's was immaculate. Can't wait to go back with the girls - since it took 2 years to convince the hubby to go!</div>

<div class="reviewquotes">Susan is a dedicated, talented nail technician. I am very loyal to her customer service because her work is beautiful and she is meticulous in her process. She answers any questions thoroughly and has a wide range of services as well as affordable weekly add-on specials. When you walk in the door, Susan puts you right at ease, always offering coffee or tea. She is truly a genuinely warm person. I always feel very relaxed and pampered after a visit and my nails look perfect. I highly recommend her services to everyone.</div>

<div class="reviewquotes">Susan is personable, professional and meticulous with her work. I've had several shellac manicures and each time Susan was gentle with gel removal, detailed in the polish, and provided high quality service. The shellac manicure lasted over two weeks and was worth every penny. Susan's Pedi Spa has a warm atmosphere with large windows, natural light and relaxing music.</div>

<div class="reviewquotes">Detailed, detailed and detailed. I came in with a specific design for my pedicure; french manicure with red polka dots in the clear area-loved her attention for detail, especially after i smudged one of my toes. Her welcoming personality, detail to your needs and intimate, cozy setting  makes for a visit to this business. Great customer service was given and felt by my daughter and I. Be generous in allotting your time for your appointment, nothing quality comes from a rushed job.  I am use to the in and out rushed feeling of most SoCal nail salons. Appointments are a must. Prices are comparative to other salons in area.</div>

<div class="reviewquotes">As usual, my pedicure experience with SUSAN-was wonderful! Relaxing-a respite from my hectic day. AND....i love my "toe color"-so much that I bought it the day day-along with another OPI polish. I am sure I will become a "regular" client of Susan's-I have made my next appontment already.</div>
