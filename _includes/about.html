About the Owner

I would like to introduce the Proprietor, Susan Bolyen. Born in the sleepy Napa Valley of California, she spent her formative years right here in Arizona, down the hill in Cottonwood. As a young woman she attended NAU for a short time, before serving her county as a member of the United States Air Force during the Liberation of Kuwait. Having had enough of being told what to do, she established her own command, when she married her husband Thomas of 21 years and homeschooled two young men, Evan and Aaron, who now attend NAU as engineering students. She has worked as a web host and author for the internet start-up General Internet, who you may now know as the New York Times subsidiary, About.com.  She went on to partner a family Medical Billing Practice, until the untimely death of the founder and her beloved mother. She took that opportunity to reflect, retrain, and rejuvenate her career path. She re-educated herself and passed the State Board Exam to become a Certified Nail Technician of the great state of Arizona.  As Susan continues to improve, her latest adventure in education will be to complete the requirements for a Bachelor of Science in Podology.
